Adds a server side check for a mandatory app update and server-side configuration options to your iOS/tvOS application.

Useful things you can do with ManUp:

- Prevent users from using the app during server-side maintenance üöß
- Remotely disable your app (killswitch) üõë
- Disable specific features in the app from the server üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Recommend (or require) that users update to a specific version or higher ‚è¨

## Installation

The preferred method is via CocoaPods:

```pod
pod 'ManUp'
```

## Usage

ManUp will download a ManUp configuration file (json) that is hosted on a server of your choice. This file will have the current app store version, the minimum version, and a URL to the app store or app website.

```json
{
  "ios": {
    "url": "https://itunes.apple.com/app/id0000000?mt=8",
    "latest": "2.0",
    "minimum": "1.1",
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

Running ManUp will download this file and compare it to the installed app's version to determine if there is an update available (`latest`), or if there is a mandatory update required (`minimum`).

#### Swift

```swift
import ManUp

// keep a strong reference
let manUp = ManUp()

// typically in applicationDidBecomeActive
self.manUp.configURL = URL(string: "https://clientfiles.nextfaze.com/eva/maintenanceMode.json")
self.manUp.delegate = nil
self.manUp.validate()
```

#### Objective-C

```objc
#import <ManUp/ManUp.h>

// keep a strong reference
@property (nonatomic, strong) ManUp *manUp;

self.manUp = [[ManUp alloc] initWithConfigURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://yourserver.com/config.json"] delegate:self];
[self.manUp validate];
```

You can also add any keys and values to the json file, which will be accessible like so:

```objc
id value = [self.manUp settingForKey:"key"];
```

This can be used however you see fit, for example to enable/disable app features.
